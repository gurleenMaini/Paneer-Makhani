First we will prepare the Makhani gravy:
So first we will heat a pan and then we will add Cumin seeds, Green cardamom, Kashmiri red chillies, Garlic cloves, ginger, Onion, tomatoes, coriander powder, cashew nuts, turmeric powder, salt and then we will add water to it and will mix it well. Then add garam masala and butter and mix it well again. Cover it with lid and cook for 15 minutes on medium heat. After 15 minutes mix it and let it cool down. After it will be cool down, grind it and make a very fine paste of it. Now your Makhani gravy is ready.
Now for the paneer:
Heat a pan and add butter and oil. Then add cumin seeds, ginger, green chillies and then add paneer cubes to it and sprinkle salt on it. Light fry the paneer. Then take out the paneer cubes from the pan and add kashmiri red chilli powder in it. Now add the Makhani gravy in it and cook it for 2-3 minutes. Add a little bit of water if your gravy is very thick. Then add Honey/sugar (optional), kasuri methi, garam masala and salt. Cook it for 2-3 minutes and turn off the flame. Now add fresh cream to it and mix well.
For finishing touch:
Add butter and fresh coriander and mix it. At last add it in a bowl and on above add some fresh cream.

Now finally our Paneer Makhani is ready. Enjoy this with lachha pratha.
